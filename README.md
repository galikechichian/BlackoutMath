# BlackoutMath
A command-line game that lets you either:
1. Solve an equation with the following valid operators: +, -, x, /, ^
2. Create a solvable equation given the number of tries, the length, and the percentage of an additional digit.

The way to solve those equations (or more so Blackout Math puzzles), is to remove either digits or operators in order to make the left hand side equal to the right hand side. 

For example, given the equation 
6 - 5 = 15 ^ 4/2

We can remove the digit 5 and the / operator from the right-hand side in order to obtain the correct
equality
6 - 5 = 1 ^ 42.

Both sides of the equation now equal to 1.
